# CO2 Emission Prediction
## Project Description
Since 1995, the Government of Canada provides model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in the country. This data can be obtained in the [government website](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64). 

This project aims to create a model capable of predicting a vehicle's estimated CO2 emission in units of g/km, based on the properties provided in the dataset. The data used ranges from the years of 2018 to 2022.
